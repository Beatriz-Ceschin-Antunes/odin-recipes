    <p>Paella (pai·ei·uh) is a classic Spanish rice dish made with rice, saffron, vegetables, chicken, and seafood cooked and served in one pan.

     <h4>Steps</h4>
     <ol>
        <li><strong>Sauté</strong>-  Add olive oil to a skillet over medium heat. Add onion, bell peppers and garlic and sauté until onion is translucent. Add chopped tomato, bay leaf, paprika, saffron, salt and pepper. Stir and cook for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Add wine</strong>- Add white wine and cook for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Add chicken and rice</strong>- Then, add chopped parsley and cook for 1 minute.</li>
        <li><strong>Add broth</strong>- Pour the broth slowly all around the pan and jiggle the pan to get the rice into an even layer. (Do not stir the mixture going forward!). Bring mixture to a boil. Reduce heat to medium low. Give the pan a gentle shake back and forth once or twice during cooking.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook uncovered</strong>- Cook paella uncovered for 15-18 minutes, then nestle the shrimp, mussels and calamari into the mixture, sprinkle peas on top and continue to cook (without stirring) for about 5 more minutes. Watch for most of the liquid to be absorbed and the rice at the top nearly tender.</li>
        <li><strong>Cover and let rest</strong>- Remove pan from heat and cover pan with a lid or tinfoil. Place a kitchen towel over the lid and allow to rest for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve</strong>- Garnish with fresh parsley and lemon slices. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
